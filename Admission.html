        <h2>Admission</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
          Admission presupposes that a student’s application has satisfactorily met all the entrance requirements of the School.
          Enrolment in the School is a contractual relationship between the students and the Administration. A student is admitted with definite understanding that he and his parents or guardians agree to comply with the scholastic standards of the School and its rules governing student’s behavior. The administration is empowered to deal with violations in accordance with its systems of discipline and guidance.
          Admission to the School is made with no discrimination on the grounds of religious belief, race, sex, age or physical disability.
